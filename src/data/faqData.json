          "answer": "I typically need a clear description of your project goals, target audience, any design preferences, technical requirements, and timeline expectations. The more details you can provide, the better I can tailor my approach. For larger projects, I'll provide a detailed questionnaire to help you articulate your vision. I'm also happy to schedule an initial consultation call to discuss your needs more thoroughly."

          "question": "How do you prioritize features when working within budget constraints?",
          "answer": "I use a value-driven approach to feature prioritization. We'll collaborate to identify \"must-have\" versus \"nice-to-have\" features based on your business goals and user needs. I implement core functionality first, then add enhancements as budget allows. This approach ensures you get a functional product that delivers value, even with limited resources. I'm transparent about what's achievable within your budget and can suggest phased implementations if needed."

I use project management tools that give you visibility into task completion and upcoming work. For day-to-day communication, I'm available through your preferred channel (email, Slack, etc.). My goal is to keep you informed without overwhelming you with technical details unless desired."

For substantial changes, I'll assess the impact on timeline and budget, then provide you with options before proceeding. I document all change requests and maintain a change log that's accessible to you. This approach ensures transparency while allowing flexibility for your evolving needs."
